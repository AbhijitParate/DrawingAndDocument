# Document and Drawing Annotation Module

The providers use drawing/sketches to record findings of patient’s examination. These drawings are later linked to the patient's medical records within OpenMRS. Document and Drawing Annotation module provides a means to create such drawings and tools to annotate them efficiently. Along with drawings, providers can also attach additional files (e.g. audios, videos, images, pdfs) to the patient’s records which are saved as a part of the encounter.

On saving, the drawing and files are persisted in the server under the encounter type “Drawing & Docs” and are made available at patient’s dashboard along with other encounters. The module also provides ability to view and edit the encounter in an intuitive way.

The module also provides ability to export the encounter as a portable file which can be restored later at a different time or machine.

A second version of the drawing editor is available as an independent standalone web application to make use of the editor without OpenMRS.
